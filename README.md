# COSC 4353 Software Design - Team 7

## Instructions

### Step 1. Download this folder.
In your terminal, navigate to your local directory of interest. I chose my desktop.

Run this command at that location.

```
git clone https://github.com/Software-DesignX/Group-Project-Team-7.git
```

You should see a folder there named `Group-project`. 



### Step 3. Commit and Push your changes.

In the terminal:

```
git pull
git add .
git commit -m "my supercool changes"
git push
```

### Step OH_MY_GOD_WHAT_HAVE_I_DONE!

No stress. Contact Dosbol Aliev on discord. If I become unresponsive, CALL ME. (832) 713-9001

If I can't talk you through it, we can definitely do a screen share and figure it out.
